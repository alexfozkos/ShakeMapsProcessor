    Description:
      Abstract: The Neotectonic Map of Alaska (Plafker and others, 1994) represents the first comprehensive compilation of tectonic faults and folds in Alaska and outlines the relative activity of post-Oligocene structures. Commonly referred to as "the Plafker map", this publication is out of print and was used as baseline information for the creation of the Quaternary fault and fold database for Alaska (Koehler and others, 2012).
      Purpose: To assist the user community and encourage more detailed mapping and paleoseismic research, we digitized the fault and fold traces from the Plafker map and created two vector shapefiles of these structures. These files are available for download.
      Supplemental_Information: The DGGS metadata standard extends the FGDC standard to include elements that are required to facilitate our internal data management. These elements, referred to as "layers", group and describe files that have intrinsic logical or topological relationships. Attribute information for the layers (entity) is included in this metadata file under the "Entity_and_Attribute_Information" section. The layers are titled: >all-faults-pflaker-1994: a shapefile of all structures from the Plafker map >prequaternary-faults-pflaker-1994: a shapefile of only the pre-Quaternary structures that were displayed on the Plafker map

  Data_Quality_Information:
    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report: The features in the dataset were entirely derived from the Neotectonic map of Alaska (Plafker, George and others, 1994). The shapefiles in this data release provide only the location of the features and do not indicate feature type (fault vs. fold). Several geologists familiar with the Neotectonic map of Alaska have examined the line-work to ensure that all fault and fold features on the originating map were replicated.
    Logical_Consistency_Report: Not applicable
    Completeness_Report: The Neotectonic map of Alaska (Plafker, George and others, 1994) represents first comprehensive compilation of tectonic faults and folds in Alaska. DGGS publication MP 141 (Koehler, R.D. and others, 2012) includes significantly more data which, in some cases, may reflect more recent interpretations. This dataset (MP150) provides only the line traces of the structures that were displayed on the Plafker map.
    Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The scale of the originating Plafker map is 1:2,500,000, thus the data are not intended for depiction on large-scale maps. After digitizing the map features we adjusted line-work as needed to correct line segments that were obviously inconsistent with the USGS National Elevation Dataset
