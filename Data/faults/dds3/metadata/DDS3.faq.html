<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
</dt><dd>

Alaska is the most seismically active region of the United States. 
However, little information exists on the location, style of 
deformation, and slip rates of Quaternary faults. This interactive map 
displays locations and relative activity of Alaska's faults and folds. 
The map offers zoom and scroll options, and multiple base map layers. 
Click individual fault and fold traces to view basic fault parameters: 
name, age, slip rate, slip sense, dip direction, mapping certainty, and 
mapped scale. This resource is intended to provide simple and quick 
means of visualizing structure locations and characteristics. Users must
 recognize mapping certainty and data accuracy limitations when zooming 
in farther than the stated mapped scale for a given feature and treat 
resulting visual representations with appropriate caveats. The 
structures displayed are replicated from DGGS publications MP 141 
(Quaternary) and MP 150 (pre-Quaternary).

</dd>
<dt><em>Supplemental_Information:</em>  
</dt><dd>

This FDGC compliant metadata file describes an interactive map 
interface. To facilitate use of the underlying datasets that are 
displayed by the interactive map application we provide a digital data 
distribution package containing the originating shapefiles and their 
associated metadata. The DGGS metadata standard extends the FGDC 
standard to include elements that are required to facilitate our 
internal data management. These elements, referred to as "layers," group
 and describe files that have intrinsic logical or topological 
relationships. Attribute information for the layers (entity) is included
 in this metadata file under the "Entity_and_Attribute_Information" 
section. The layers are titled: &gt;qflt-line-alaska: a shapefile of 
Quaternary faults and folds throughout the state of Alaska, from DGGS 
publication MP 141 &gt;prequaternary-faults-pflaker-1994: a shapefile of
 only pre-Quaternary faults and fold traces, from DGGS publication MP 
150

<h3><a name="why">Why was the data set created?</a></h3>
<blockquote>
To provide an accurate, user-friendly, reference-based fault inventory 
to the public, we have compiled an interactive map which displays 
locations and relative activity of Alaska's faults and folds. This 
resource is intended to provide simple and quick means of visualizing 
structure locations and characteristics. Users must recognize mapping 
certainty and data accuracy limitations when zooming in farther than the
 stated mapped scale for a given feature and treat resulting visual 
representations with appropriate caveats.
