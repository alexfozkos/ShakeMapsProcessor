    Description:
      Abstract: Alaska is the most seismically active region of the United States. However, little information exists on the location, style of deformation, and slip rates of Quaternary faults. This interactive map displays locations and relative activity of Alaska's faults and folds. The map offers zoom and scroll options, and multiple base map layers. Click individual fault and fold traces to view basic fault parameters: name, age, slip rate, slip sense, dip direction, mapping certainty, and mapped scale. This resource is intended to provide simple and quick means of visualizing structure locations and characteristics. Users must recognize mapping certainty and data accuracy limitations when zooming in farther than the stated mapped scale for a given feature and treat resulting visual representations with appropriate caveats. The structures displayed are replicated from DGGS publications MP 141 (Quaternary) and MP 150 (pre-Quaternary).
      Purpose: To provide an accurate, user-friendly, reference-based fault inventory to the public, we have compiled an interactive map which displays locations and relative activity of Alaskas faults and folds. This resource is intended to provide simple and quick means of visualizing structure locations and characteristics. Users must recognize mapping certainty and data accuracy limitations when zooming in farther than the stated mapped scale for a given feature and treat resulting visual representations with appropriate caveats.
      Supplemental_Information: This FDGC compliant metadata file describes an interactive map interface. To facilitate use of the underlying datasets that are displayed by the interactive map application we provide a digital data distribution package containing the originating shapefiles and their associated metadata. The DGGS metadata standard extends the FGDC standard to include elements that are required to facilitate our internal data management. These elements, referred to as "layers," group and describe files that have intrinsic logical or topological relationships. Attribute information for the layers (entity) is included in this metadata file under the "Entity_and_Attribute_Information" section. The layers are titled: >qflt-line-alaska: a shapefile of Quaternary faults and folds throughout the state of Alaska, from DGGS publication MP 141 >prequaternary-faults-pflaker-1994: a shapefile of only pre-Quaternary faults and fold traces, from DGGS publication MP 150
