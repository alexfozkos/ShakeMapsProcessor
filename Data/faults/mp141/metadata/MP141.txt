  Description:
    Abstract: This dataset contains information and locations on faults and associated folds in Alaska that are believed to be sources of M>6 earthquakes during the Quaternary (the past 1,600,000 years). The dataset is intended to part of the USGS archive for historic and ancient earthquake sources used in current and future probabilistic seismic-hazard analyses. This dataset presents a single source that summarizes important information on paleoseismic (ancient earthquakes) parameters including, age of most recent deformation, slip rate, slip sense dip direction, and accuracy of original mapping. These data are compiled from hundreds of journal articles, maps, theses, and other documents, as referenced herein. The geospatial data coverage for the state of Alaska is designed to serve a variety of needs, both in terms of the user community and methods of delivering the data.
    Purpose: Alaska is the most seismically active region of the United States, however little information exists on the location, style of deformation, and slip rates of Quaternary faults. Thus, to provide an accurate, user-friendly, reference-based fault inventory to the public, we have produced a digital GIS shapefile of the Quaternary fault traces. Relevant information pertaining to the digital GIS shapefile is presented herein. This database will be useful for engineering geologic problems, geologic, geodetic, and seismic research, and policy planning. In addition, the GIS shapefile has been made in conformance with the standards defined by the U.S. Geological Survey and this data set will be incorporated into the National Quaternary fault and fold database.
    Supplemental_Information:
      References for the fault traces and information regarding the digitizing process are recorded under Lineage section of this metadata file and in the text report that accompanies this publication release. The DGGS metadata standard extends the FGDC standard to include elements that are required to facilitate our internal data management. These elements, referred to as "layers," group and describe files that have intrinsic logical or topological relationships. This dataset is described as a single layer. Attribute information for the layer is included in this metadata file under the "Entity_and_Attribute_Information" section. The layer is titled:

  Data_Set_Credit: The authors extend gratitude to many staff members of the Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys who assisted in one way or another in the compilation of the database. Countless hours of map and literature data gathering and scanning were performed by Cheryl Cameron, Carol Gallo, and Jessica Mayer. Jim Weakland designed the ArcGIS server to host the data on-line and Ken Woods assisted in building the computer infrastructure to make the on-line interface possible. Simone Montayne assisted with metadata. Partial funding was provided by the U.S. Geological Survey National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (Grant #03WRAG0027) and the State of Alaska, Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, Earthquake Hazards Reduction State Assistance Program (Grant #39320/39507). Several members of the U.S. Geological survey were instrumental in bringing this project to fruition, including Kathy Haller, Tony Crone, George Plafker, and Mike Machette. Constructive reviews of the database by Peter Haeussler and Rob Witter (U.S. Geological Survey, Anchorage) improved the content.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: In order to maintain consistency with the National Quaternary fault & fold database standard the USGS specified the GIS fault attribute guidelines. The fields were populated based on the available literature pertaining to the Quaternary faults and folds of Alaska. Fault characteristics, even where known in detail, are reported in broad categories (for example "age less than 1,600,000 years"). More information will be published at a later date as a database of fault summary descriptions. This textural database will contain more specific information about each fault where details are available in the published literature.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: not applicable
  Completeness_Report: This dataset is incomplete and will be updated at a later date as new faults are discovered and additional research is conducted. Thus, not all active faults are included.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Locations of faults were taken from published literature; these investigations were carried out at a variety of scales of observation, hence some faults will be located more precisely and accurately than others. In general, the locations are accurate as observed on a 1:250,000 scale map, or approximately 450 feet.

      Source_Contribution: An initial list of Quaternary active structures for the Alaska fault and fold database was derived from The Neotectonic Map of Alaska
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: An initial list of Quaternary active structures for the Alaska fault and fold database was derived from The Neotectonic Map of Alaska (Plafker, George and others, 1994) and supplemented with more recent data where available. Maps and literature compiled in Craw and others (2001) and more than 1,000 references related to the project and archived at DGGS were used to determine the best fault traces to digitize, and to verify that sufficient evidence was available to classify a fault or fold as a Quaternary active structure. See APPENDIX A of the accompanying text for a complete list of references.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Quaternary faults and folds were georegistered from paper maps contained in 1970s vintage and earlier bedrock maps, and newer publications when available. The most common map scale used was 1:250,000, however, the scales range from 1:20,000 to 1:500,000. Paper maps were scanned using a large-format scanner and the resulting tiff files were georegistered in ArcMap. In some cases, the only available map traces were figures contained in published papers, making accurate registration difficult. This problem was alleviated by adding as many control points as possible to obtain a best fit to topographic base maps. Detailed inspection (measuring with a ruler) of several maps published at 1:250,000 scale revealed that the scale was not correct. For these maps, digitizing was based on terrain matching between source maps and the digital fault database. Source map data was in a wide variety of projections common in Alaska. Thus, source data was imported in its native projection and reprojected to the database projection (for instance, NAD 27 UTM to GCS WGS 1984). With the exception of the Denali fault, tectonic features were not digitized in Canada. General boundaries of seismic zones in interior Alaska were defined based on seismicity in Ruppert and others (2008). See the accompanying text for a complete list of references and a more thorough description of the methodology.
